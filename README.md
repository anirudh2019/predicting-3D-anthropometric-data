## Predicting 3D anthropometric measurements
- A neural network model is designed to predict 3D anthropometric measurements from height, weight, gender and body shape from ANSUR-II dataset.
- The model predicts 13 anthropometric measurements as follows:
    Sleeves Length, Shoulder Width, Chest Around, Neck, Torso Length, Bicep Around, 
    Leg Length, Waist, Hips, Thigh, Rise, Wrist, Breast point
    
**Results:** 
- After training the model, mean squared error on test dataset is 836.26 and mean absolute error 
on test dataset is 21.14. 
- The below figure shows plots of mean squared error Vs epochs and mean absolute error Vs epochs.
